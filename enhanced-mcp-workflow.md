## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use MCP SuperAssistant with Your Workflow**

### **Method 1: Daily Intelligence Briefing**

**Copy this prompt to ChatGPT/Claude after connecting MCP:**

```text
I have a comprehensive news system with both automated collection and real-time MCP tools. Please create an intelligence briefing:

1. Use MCP to fetch 10 latest headlines for current analysis
2. I also have a complete archive in 'allafrica-headlines.txt' with downloaded images
3. Compare today's headlines with recent patterns
4. Identify breaking news vs ongoing stories
5. Create a professional briefing with:
   - Executive summary
   - Key developments
   - Notable trends
   - Recommended actions
6. Save the analysis to 'intelligence-brief-[DATE].txt'

Context: My system automatically downloads images and creates comprehensive archives daily. Use this for enhanced analysis.
```

### **Method 2: Image-Enhanced Content Creation**

```text
I need social media content using my news system:

1. Fetch 15 current headlines via MCP
2. For the top 5 stories, reference that I have local images in ./images/ folder
3. Create engaging social media posts that mention image availability
4. Suggest which local images would work best for each story
5. Generate captions that leverage both headline and visual content
6. Save content strategy to 'social-content-[DATE].txt'

My system downloads article images automatically, so factor that into content recommendations.
```

### **Method 3: Research with Historical Context**

```text
Conduct research analysis on [YOUR TOPIC] using my hybrid news system:

1. Use MCP to get current headlines related to [TOPIC]
2. Cross-reference with my archived headlines in 'allafrica-headlines.txt'
3. Analyze trends over time (current vs historical)
4. Note stories that have accompanying images in ./images/ folder
5. Create research report with:
   - Current status
   - Historical context
   - Visual content availability
   - Research conclusions
6. Save to '[TOPIC]-research-enhanced-[DATE].txt'

Leverage both real-time MCP data and my comprehensive local archive.
