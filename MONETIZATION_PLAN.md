# Monetization & Free Growth Plan

## 1. Audience Building (Free-First)
- Use GitHub Pages (free) to publish your reports as a website.
- Share your GitHub Pages link on social media, forums, and newsletters.
- Use free newsletter tools (Substack, Buttondown, Mailchimp free tier) to build a subscriber base.

## 2. Free Domain
- Register a free domain at [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/) (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq) or [eu.org](https://nic.eu.org/) (.eu.org).
- Point your domain to your GitHub Pages site for a professional look.

## 3. Donations & Community Support
- Add a free donation button (Ko-fi, BuyMeACoffee, OpenCollective) to your GitHub Pages site.
- Encourage community contributions and sharing.

## 4. Future Monetization (Optional)
- Once you have an audience, consider adding premium newsletters, reports, or consulting.
- Use only free tools and platforms to keep costs at zero.
